# Progress Tracking - Data Dashboard Implementation

## Original Requirement (English Translation):
I have a Kaggle dataset named "first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx" called "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025", focusing on 3 questions about AI agent performance:

(1) What are the top 3 agent types with the highest proportion of multimodal processing support (multimodal_capability) within each agent type, ranked from highest to lowest?

(2) What are the top 3 model architectures with the highest proportion of multimodal processing support (multimodal_capability) within each architecture, ranked from highest to lowest?

(3) What are the top 3 agent task categories with the highest median bias detection scores, ranked from highest to lowest?

I want to visualize this dataset by creating a comprehensive data dashboard in HTML format named "data-dashboard.html". The dashboard should include data visualization design and display the actual number of dataset records processed (this dataset has 80 records total, please only show the number of rows you actually read and processed). Please use a light color scheme for the dashboard and provide directly runnable static HTML code. No dynamic effects or static images needed, and don't depend on loading Excel files to run the HTML code. Ensure all charts display completely in mobile browsers. Please save the Python code used to read the Excel dataset and analyze data to a file named "read-excel-data.py" for later execution and code review.

## Implementation Progress:

**Step 1 Complete:** Created read-excel-data.py file with required import statements (pandas and json)

**Step 2 Complete:** Implemented load_excel_data() function with error handling for Excel file reading

**Step 3 Complete:** Implemented analyze_agent_type_multimodal() function to calculate and display top 3 agent types by multimodal percentage

**Step 4 Complete:** Implemented analyze_model_architecture_multimodal() function to calculate and display top 3 model architectures by multimodal percentage

**Step 5 Complete:** Implemented analyze_task_category_bias() function to calculate and display top 3 task categories by median bias detection score

**Step 6 Complete:** Implemented generate_dashboard_data() function to format all analysis results for HTML embedding as JSON

**Step 7 Complete:** Added main execution block to run all analysis functions sequentially and print comprehensive results

**Step 8 Complete:** Successfully tested Python script - all analytical results verified and match expected values from research phase

**Steps 9-13 Complete:** Created complete HTML structure with CSS styling, header section, and main content grid with three chart containers

**Steps 14-25 Complete:** Embedded dashboard data, implemented all Chart.js configurations for three responsive charts, and completed final testing and validation
