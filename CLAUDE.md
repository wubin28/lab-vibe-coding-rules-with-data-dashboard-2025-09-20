# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a data analysis repository containing an Excel dataset (`first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx`) focused on agentic AI performance metrics. The repository appears to be in early setup phase with minimal structure.

## Repository Structure

- Root directory contains only:
  - `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore rules for Python, Node.js, IDEs, and Excel files
  - `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` - Primary dataset file
  - `.git/` - Git repository metadata

## Development Environment

The `.gitignore` suggests this project may involve:
- **Python development** - Python cache, virtual environments, and build artifacts are ignored
- **JavaScript/Node.js development** - Node modules and related files are ignored
- **Data analysis** - Excel temporary files and cache directories are ignored

## Key Files

- `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` - Primary dataset containing 80 rows of agentic AI performance data from June 2022

## Project Status

This appears to be a newly initialized repository for data dashboard development, likely intended for analyzing agentic AI performance metrics. No specific build tools, frameworks, or development commands have been configured yet.
