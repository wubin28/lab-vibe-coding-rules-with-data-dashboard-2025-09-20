Requirements Translation:

I have a Kaggle dataset called "first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx" from "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025" focusing on 3 questions about AI agent performance:

(1) Among agent types (agent_type), rank the top 3 types by the percentage that support multimodal processing (multimodal_capability)

(2) Among model architectures (model_architecture), rank the top 3 architectures by the percentage that support multimodal processing (multimodal_capability)

(3) Among task categories (task_category), rank the top 3 categories by the median of bias detection scores (bias_detection)

I want to visualize this dataset and generate a comprehensive HTML dashboard named "data-dashboard.html". The dashboard should include data visualizations and display the actual number of processed data records (this dataset has 80 records total, but show only the actual number of rows read and processed).

Use a light color theme design and provide directly runnable HTML static code. No dynamic effects or static images needed, and don't rely on loading Excel files to run the HTML code. Ensure all charts display completely in mobile browsers.

Save the Python code used to read the Excel dataset and analyze the data to a file named "read-excel-data.py" so I can run and check the code later.Step 1: Created Python script structure with all required functions for data analysis and visualization
Step 2: Successfully loaded Excel data with 80 records using pandas with proper header handling
Step 3: Implemented Question 1 analysis - Top 3 Agent Types by Multimodal Percentage
Step 4: Implemented Question 2 analysis - Top 3 Model Architectures by Multimodal Percentage
Step 5: Implemented Question 3 analysis - Top 3 Task Categories by Median Bias Detection Score
Step 6: All three analytical questions successfully implemented and tested
